## Notes

Implementing a sticky header required adding `scroll-padding-top` and adjusting target offsets so section headings weren’t hidden under the navbar.
Ensuring the search filter didn’t duplicate cards involved clearing child elements before rendering new results.
Added CSS-only smooth scrolling and subtle transparency effects on scroll for the navbar.
